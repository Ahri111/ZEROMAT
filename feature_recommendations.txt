Query: What are the most important features for predicting bandgap?
================================================================================
AI Response:
**RECOMMENDED FEATURES:**
1. density - Higher density materials often correlate with larger bandgaps due to stronger bonding and reduced atomic separation.
2. formation_energy_per_atom - Lower formation energies suggest more stable structures, which can influence the bandgap.
3. volume - The unit cell volume affects the electronic structure and spacing of energy levels, impacting the bandgap.
4. crystal_system - Different crystal systems can exhibit varying electronic properties and bandgap characteristics.
5. is_metal - Metallic character directly indicates the absence of a bandgap, making this a crucial feature for predicting bandgap values.
6. num_elements - The number of different elements can influence the complexity of the electronic structure and thus the bandgap.
7. bulk_modulus - The bulk modulus relates to the material's compressibility, which can affect electronic properties and bandgap.
8. shear_modulus - Similar to bulk modulus, shear modulus provides insights into the material's mechanical stability, which can influence electronic behavior.
